## Char Arrays & Strings 1:

**Important Note Of Character Array:**

1. cin input will stop taking input if we hit the space. It will still take input but it won't store the character after space as space is considered as terminator.
2. To take input with space : cin.getline(arr, size, delimiter) -> space is default delimiter in cin, but with getline we can give out custom delimiter.
