**IMP notes :**

1. Vector is a dynamic array

2. Vector 2X the capacity whenever it feels short of memory. That's why we don't need to define any size for it.

3. Declaration : vector<data_type> v.

4. v.push_back() use to push any data.

5. v.pop_back() use to delete any data form the last.

6. v.at(index) use to print any data of that index.

7. v.clear use to clear the entire vector.

8. vector<int>arr1(size,data) -> this will set the vector with default size( not fixed ) with the data.

9. vector<int>arr2(arr1) -> this will copy all the data in arr1 to arr2.

10. v.front(), v.back() give data of both front and back.
