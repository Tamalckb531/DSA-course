## DP 1

<b>Top-down approach of DP :</b> solve it in recursive way -> store the ans of recursion in an array and return it from the array -> before doing recursive process, look at the dp array if the ans for the changeable variable parameter is exist or not. <br/>

<b>Bottom-up approach of DP :</b> create dp array -> analyze base cases and update dp array -> check parameter and reverse it and run a loop <br/>

<b>Space Optimization approach of DP :</b>dry run the logical part under loop of Bottom-up -> find pattern -> optimize the space using it<br/>
